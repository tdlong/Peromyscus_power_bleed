# for loops is being used because to calculate the Mjj_sum,
# in an ideal world, the counter and Mjj_sum would come out as one line
# but in reality, that would take up too much memory,
# so we had to split up the task into an array job;
# thus, the are many different Mjj_sum and counter values that
# need to be summer even further.
