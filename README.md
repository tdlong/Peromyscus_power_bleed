# Peromyscus_power_bleed
Code associated with the peromyscus power / bleed-time paper (Long et al 2021)

## Kinship matrix
*generate_Mjj.sh* generates a kinship matrix, provided the following arguments:
1. save_data folder path
2. software folder path
3. path to list of gzipped vcf filepaths
4. path to subset list of individuals
5. path to full list of individuals
6. path to output file of relatedness values



## Simulating phenotypes
*generate_Y.sh* generates simulated phenotypes for 3 different genetic models at a causative locus, provided the following arguments:
1. save_data folder path
2. software folder path
3. path to list of gzipped vcf filepaths
4. path to gzipped vcf file of the chromosome for which we want our causative SNP from
5. position of causative snp
6. path to subset list of individuals
7. path to full list of individuals



## Scans
*scan.sh* performs both a marker- and haplotype-based scan of a chromosome given a phenotype, provided the following arguments:
1. save_data folder path
2. software folder path
3. path to gzipped vcf file of the chromosome that scans are performed on
4. path to subset list of individuals
5. path to full list of individuals
6. path to phenotype file
7. name of column for the phenotype in the phenotype file
8. path to kinship matrix data
9. results folder path
10. path to file where the filepath of a scan is printed to when the scan is completed
11. genetic model (either "single", "multiple", or "rare")



## Bleeding time data (and normalization)
```R
k5 <- read.table(file = "k5.txt")

# normalize Bleeding time
hist(k5$BleedTime)
oo = rank(k5$BleedTime)/(397 - 1)/(2 * 397)
k5$normBleed = qnorm(oo)
plot(x = k5$normBleed, y = k5$BleedTime)

# check for fixed factors affecting bleeding time
anova(lm(formula = normBleed ~ Sex + Age + Weight + timeDOB,
         data = k5))
k5$residNormBleed <- lm(formula = normBleed ~ Sex + Age + timeDOB,
                        data = k5)$resid
write.table(x = k5,
            file = "k5.txt")
```
```
